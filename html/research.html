                    <div>
                        <p>Food Science is fun. By understanding the principles involved in the preparation of food and
                            through experiments, it is interesting to know more about the food that you eat and drink.
                            There are physical, chemical and biological factors involved in the nutrition, safety and
                            quality aspect of food. The main components of food are protein, carbohydrates, fats and
                            water. The complexity of food attribute to the processing and ingredients used for its
                            preparation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taste is king. Natural foods like fruits, vegetables and leaves provide a ‘food matrix’
                            which is more bioavailable to our body. Such foods contain phytosterols, glucans,
                            antioxidants, good fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, and are good for health. An example
                            as part of my learning from soy and isoflavone research is that, an intake of 25 gm of soy
                            protein has associated isoflavones present in it and such food matrices are beneficial for
                            good health.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are what you eat. Each of your cell is made from those nutrients that was extracted from
                            the food that you consumed. So make a healthier choice.

                    <h2>Material Chemistry & Bioengineering</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Materials and polymers combined with nanotechnological approaches enable advancement in the
                            field of tissue regeneration and drug delivery. Natural polymers provide hydrophilicity to
                            scaffolds, while synthetic polymers impart mechanical strength, and were used for the repair
                            of tissues. Physical, biochemical and biological properties of scaffolds ultimately helped
                            in cell compatibility, proliferation and even differentiation (of stem cells). Electrospun
                            fibers mimicked the extracellular matrix of cells/tissues and enabled regeneration of
                            tissues, and it helped advance the field of tissue engineering.

                        <p>
                            Nanofibers are fibers with diameter of nanometer range, and electrospinning was used for the
                            fabrication of nanofibers of various architectures. Nerve cells will align if provided with
                            a contact guidance using aligned fibers, while core-shell fibers are more appropriate for
                            the delivery of certain molecules, and random fibers could be applied as a skin patch.
                            Micro/nano particles generated by electrospraying were used for drug delivery applications.
                            Molecules like proteins, growth factors and drugs were incorporated within these particles
                            and used as drug delivery vehicles.

                    <div>
                        <p>I have a deep passion towards instrumental analysis. It started with Gas Chromatography while
                            monitoring reactions during my R&D work with fine chemicals, to prepare Iso Amyl Acetate,
                            Fructone, Methyl salicylate etc. Research on the quantification of isoflavones helped me
                            expand this learning to HPLC and LC-MS, while most of the polymer material characterizations
                            provided me explore my learning to almost all analytical instruments including the SEM, TEM,
                            UV-Vis, AFM, FTIR, XPS, EDX and other microscopic analysis such as fluorescence/ confocal
                            microscopy for cell-material interaction studies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Figures and images drawn from plenty of experiments is a fantasy to collect and it raise
                            your imagination, and are impactful when publishing the results of research projects.
