                        <p>Food Science is fun. By understanding the principles involved in the preparation of food and
                            through experiments, it is interesting to know more about the food that you eat and drink.
                            There
                            are physical, chemical and biological factors involved in the nutrition, safety and quality
                            aspect of food. Main components of food are the protein, carbohydrates, fats and water. The
                            complexity of food also attribute to the processing and ingredients used for its
                            preparation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taste is king. Functional ingredients present in food provide additional benefit to us.
                            Natural
                            foods like fruits, vegetables and leaves provide a 'food matrix' that is more bioavailable
                            to
                            our body. Such foods that naturally contain phytosterols, glucans, antioxidants, good fatty
                            acids, vitamins and minerals provide health benefits. My research also support the fact (as
                            an
                            example), that an intake of 25 gm of soy protein has associated isoflavones present in it
                            and
                            such food matrices are beneficial for good health.

                            You are what you eat. Each of your cell is made from those nutrients that was extracted from
                            the
                            food that you consumed. So make a healthier choice.

                        <p>Materials and polymers combined with nanotechnological approaches enable advancement in the
                            field
                            of tissue regeneration and drug delivery. Natural and synthetic polymers have properties
                            that
                            when combined provide hydrophilicity to scaffolds with mechanical strength tailored to match
                            the
                            concerned tissue of repair. Physical, biochemical and biological properties of scaffolds
                            ultimately helped in cell compatibility, proliferation and even differentiation (of stem
                            cells).

                            Nanofibers are fibers with diameter of nanometer range, and nanofibers of various
                            architectures
                            were prepared by electrospinning. Nerve cells will align if provided with a contact guidance
                            using aligned fibers, while core-shell fibers might be more appropriate for delivery of
                            certain
                            molecules, and random fibers could be used as a skin patch. Micro/Nano particles were
                            generated
                            by electrospraying, and used for drug delivery purposes. Molecules like proteins, growth
                            factors
                            and drugs were incorporated for such application.</p>

                            Electrospun fibers mimicked the extracellular matrix of cells/tissues and enabled
                            regeneration
                            of tissues, and it helped advance the field of tissue engineering

                        <p>My passion for instruments started with Gas Chromatography when using it to monitor reactions
                            during my R&D work with fine chemicals, such as the preparation of Iso Amyl Acetate,
                            Fructone,
                            Methyl salicylate etc. Research on the quantification of isoflavones opened the path towards
                            the
                            learning of HPLC and LC-MS, while most of the polymer material characterizations helped
                            fulfil
                            my passion towards almost all analytical instruments including the SEM, TEM, UV-Vis, AFM,
                            FTIR,
                            XPS, EDX and other microscopic analysis such as fluorescence/ confocal microscopy for
                            cell-material interaction studies.
