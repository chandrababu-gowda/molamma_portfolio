                    <h2>The artist way</h2>
                    <h4>Julia Cameron</h4>
                    <p>
                        Morning pages get us to the other side of our fear, negativity, moods etc. The place we hear our
                        own quiet, the still. Morning pages map our own interior. If you write morning pages faithfully,
                        it will led to a connection with a source of wisdom within. Doing your morning pages, you are
                        sending or notifying yourself and to the universe of your dreams. Doing your ARTIST DATE, you
                        are on receiving or opening yourself to inspiration, insight and guidance. See the beauty of
                        those 2 sentences, Julia Cameron put things in simplicity and this is what connected to me about
                        her writing. It is amazing to see how she get tremendous amount of words with originality and
                        purity, pouring a lot of sense in the way she speaks to us through this book.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Through the morning pages, we learn what we want and ultimately become willing to make the
                        changes needed to get it. Logic brain is the brain that we usually listen to. Artist brain is
                        our inventor! It makes connections, yoking together images to invoke meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        If you see yourself avoiding artist date, then recognize that resistance as a fear of
                        self-intimacy!! Our creativity will be using this artist date to confront us, confide in us,
                        bond with us and to plan. Isn't that a great thing. She again put a better perspective - Morning
                        pages acquaint us with what we think and what we need, identify problems and concerns. In our
                        artist date, we begin to hear SOLUTIONS, a creative reserve will emerge in front of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Art may seem to spring from pain, could be that pain serves to focus our attention. In times of
                        pain, when future is terrifying to contemplate and past is too painful to remember, she said she
                        paid attention to the right now. The precise moment I am in is the only safe place for me. Each
                        moment, taken alone was always bearable. These details from the book is really an eye opening
                        statement. It is also asking us to be present in this NOW, and this moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Art lies in the moment of encounter, we meet our truth. We become original because we become
                        something specific. Once we lost our vagueness about our self, our life situation, we become
                        available to the moment. It is that moment and there we contact the creative self. Solitude
                        helps to connect authentically. We lose the false self we were sustaining. One of the clearest
                        things that something healthy is on the way is when we weed out, sort through and discard old
                        items and belongings. We make way for the new and suitable. When the search and discard impulse
                        seizes you, two crosscurrents are at work - the old you is leaving and new you celebrates and
                        grow strong. You find yourself volatile and changeable and you are. Be prepared for the burst of
                        tears and of laughter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personal take away for me: I included these words into my deck of cards. I receive your good
                        willingly. I trust my perceptions. A stronger and clearer me is emerging. I enjoy my identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Regular repetitive activities are times when our logic brain tips over to creative artist brain
                        - noticed you getting a new solution' during your shower or tea-time! Creativity or those
                        insights come to us as flashes. </p>
                    <p>

                        An affirmation is a positive statement of belief. Affirmations are like prescriptions for
                        certain aspects of yourself you want to change. Convert all blurts from your morning pages into
                        affirmations. </p>
                    <p>

                        Understand that the WHAT must come before the HOW. First choose what you would do, and the how
                        falls in place by itself. What you think you can do or believe you can do, begin it. Action has
                        magic and power in it. </p>
                    <p>

                        As each idea comes to us, we must be in good faith, clear away the inner barriers to act on it
                        and take concrete steps necessary to trigger our synchronous good. Listen to our intuitive voice
                        that says - Do this, Try this, Say this. With practice we learn how to hear the desired
                        frequency on request. You experience finding seminars, books etc that happen to fit with what
                        you are doing. </p>
                    <p>

                        Experiment with SOLITUDE. Make a commitment to your quiet time. It is a habit to checking in
                        with yourself. Several times a day, ask yourself - how are you feeling? Listen and respond
                        kindly. </p>
                    <p>

                        The BEST of the BEST I got from this book is this: Perform this two step process- Ask for
                        answers in the evening, listen for answers in the morning. We listen by writing our morning
                        pages. At night before we fall asleep, we list areas in which we need guidance. Next day when
                        writing we find ourselves seeing previously unseen avenues of approach/ solutions. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Replace your 'no way' with 'May be'. </li>
                        <li>Safety is a very expensive illusion.</li>
                        <li>Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. We may be wrong, but we
                            take leap after leap in the dark.</li>
                        <li>Jealousy is always a mask for fear. Jealousy produces tunnel vision.</li>
                        <li>Treating myself like a precious object will make me strong.</li>
                        <li>Every END is a beginning. Brutally ask : How can this loss serve me? Replace why me with
                            'what next'. </li>
                        <li>I acknowledge you and your pain. Buy a bunch of tulips for yourself, or a sketch pad, your
                            action says and promise you a future worth having.</li>
                        <li>Artist date: List 20 things you enjoy doing, and you could choose one each for your artist
                            date. That's a wonderful idea.</li>
                        <li>Begin a file of dreams: collect images, photograph them, clip them or collect it somehow.
                            With these images, begin a file of dreams that speak to you.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Julia suggest that we band in clusters and encourage each other, and get the best out of this
                        creative cluster. Success occurs in clusters. </p>

                    <h2>Feel the fear and do it any way </h2>
                    <h4>Susan Jeffers</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am not sure how I came across this book, but mostly it could have come from recommended
                        reading list elsewhere. I am not a bold person and when I saw this book title, I felt I should
                        really have a look at it. As the book says, Fear holds us back from personal growth. Fear will
                        never go away as long as I continue to grow. Most people never take time to focus on what they
                        want!! </p>
                    <p>


                        If something is troubling you, simple start to take actions necessary to change it. The only way
                        to get rid of the fear is by doing it. Go out and do it. That's how you move from pain to power.
                        Pushing through fear is less frightening than living with that fear (of helplessness). Play with
                        life instead of fighting it. Fear gives the opportunity to stretch your capacity each time.
                        Take a risk each day. At least try! With each risk you take, you are expanding. The old
                        conditioning is only keeping us weak. </p>
                    <p>


                        You are the cause of all your experiences of life. Taking responsibility is the first step,
                        never blaming anyone else. Anger is the clue that you are not taking responsibility. I like this
                        phrase: The inner clues that come as dissatisfaction & confusion, is when it is telling you that
                        it is time to correct (or this is called 'learning when to correct'). Taking responsibility
                        means handling the chatterbox. Being aware of payoffs that keep you stuck. When you understand
                        the payoffs, your behaviour will make much more sense to you. Taking responsibility means being
                        aware of the multitude of choices you have in a given situation. Pick the one that contributes
                        most to your aliveness and growth. </p>
                    <p>


                        About 90% of what we worry about never happens. Positive words make us physically strong. Inner
                        self reacts to what it is fed. Practice positive thinking like how you shower every day!
                        Buy some wonderful posters and decorate your wall. Keep changing the quotes. Select affirmations
                        that feel right for you at any given time. It keep you uplifted. It outtalk your chatterbox.
                        Positive thinking needs daily practice as well. You can lead a productive & meaningful life no
                        matter what the external circumstances are. Life is not to be taken so seriously. When we are
                        concerned with something bigger than ourselves, our fears are greatly diminished. Remember
                        nothing comes to you like that!! You must make the effort. Go out and create the support system
                        that you want. </p>
                    <p>


                        Family situations: Often a great deal of possessiveness is felt by family members, and with that
                        comes a tremendous amount of manipulation. The lashing out/ anger usually comes from the
                        unhealthy attachment. The less you need someone's approval, the more you are able to love them.
                        Acknowledgement of pain is important and denial is deadly. </p>
                    <p>


                        Inner strength comes from what we put in (and that is what you get back). Discover slowly which
                        path in life will make you grow and that is the path for you to take. By not choosing, you are
                        also choosing to starve. Underlying of all our fears is the lack of trust in ourselves. We have
                        been taught that negatives are realistic and positives are unrealistic (oh, yeah can you relate
                        this. We hear this often from our surroundings!!). On the other hand, did you notice that every
                        time you handle something, your self-esteem is raised? More clarity is attained of an idea, when
                        you talk, so talk it out. Yes, it is through confusion that you come to clarity. Your
                        subconscious mind always sends knowing messages as to which choice is better (& that is when we
                        say - I listened to my gut, go for it). Also once you take responsibility of the decision, you
                        are less angry at yourself and to the world. Once it's not for you, move on to something else.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Get into the world: Shift from being afraid of making a mistake to being afraid of not making a
                        mistake. Say to yourself ' IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER'. </p>
                    <p>


                        Action and commitment are two powerful tools that can change life. Commitment is giving 100% in
                        whatever you do. Enhance your commitment in each area of your life. By doing so your quality of
                        life will improve 100% too. It may not necessarily mean forever. Contribution is how you make
                        that difference in this world. It brings self-esteem and satisfaction in life. Its all about our
                        attitude that is making the difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Say YES to the universe & create meaning to your life. Try nodding your head (up and down) to
                        create acceptance and notice you feel positive (& everything is going to be alright). Many of us
                        are waiting for a perfect time. Create the kind of space that you would like to live in.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Giving is an acquired skill. The world is full of takers. Most of us in our society donot really
                        know how to give. We can't give because our survival is involved. No matter how much you have in
                        life, nothing would ever be enough! Focus on all the blessings in your life. Create this book of
                        'I have'…Think of this: 'I want to be thoroughly used up'. </p>
                    <p>


                        Tap into your higher self. </p>

                    <h2>A New Earth</h2>
                    <h4>Eckart Tolle</h4>
                    <p>
                        Freedom from unhappiness is attainable. If there is an awareness in you, it guides you not to
                        believe in every thought that kicks in. Suffering eventually destroys the ego. The fire of
                        suffering becomes the light of consciousness. Whenever you interact with people, be a field of
                        conscious presence. The ego tries to tell us that 'you are not enough'. You are neither inferior
                        nor superior to anyone. True self-esteem and humility arise out of that realisation. The ego
                        might say I am holding you responsible for my pain (of anger, anxiety, hatred, resentment,
                        discontent etc). The ego creates separation, and separation creates suffering. Many people spent
                        a large part of their life in resentment. Underlying that feeling are some unconsciously held
                        beliefs or thoughts. Ego try to not bring peace in you because ego doesn't know the only time
                        you can be at peace is the NOW. Ego thrives on the unhappiness. Suffering or negativity is often
                        misperceived by the ego as pleasure because up to a point the ego strengthens itself through it.
                        Become aware of your ego. When you notice that happens, then shift from ego to awareness. In
                        such a way ego shrinks and awareness grow. On a larger whole all things are connected. </p>
                    <p>


                        Be attentive to your thoughts and emotions. Emotions and thoughts can be depersonalized through
                        awareness. </p>
                    <p>


                        Ego needs others, but it hates and fears them. The stronger ego in you tells that other people
                        are the source of your problems. Let go of identification of your mind. Who you are beyond the
                        mind then emerges by itself. Going against ego, is by including more of others, and more
                        smoothly things start to flow. Ego burns up a lot of your energy. Thinking is involuntary most
                        times. Density of ego depends on degree to which you are identified with your mind. But in
                        actual thinking is just 1% of the totality of who you are. Have you felt like getting home, but
                        never feel at home, ie, don't feel the ease in any situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        An emotion is body's response to thought. The voice from your head tells a story, believe in it
                        and the reactions created are the emotions. No situation or event is really ever finished.
                        Thoughts from your past turn into a burden. They limit you. We hang on to that old emotion and
                        it get strengthened as your identity. The old emotional pain called as body pain exist for
                        everyone. When this comes, bring your awareness to the NOW. Pain-body and ego are close
                        relatives. Emotional pain sabotage intimate relationships. It brings a false sense of self. All
                        thought is energy, and pain-body is feeding on the energy of your thoughts.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The conscious PRESENCE can break your pain-body identification. Every human being emanates an
                        energy field depending on his or her inner state. Presence enable one to dis-identify their own
                        pain-body with awakening. Choose to step out of identification with thinking and emotion and
                        enter the state of presence. The knowing needs to be followed by acceptance. This acceptance
                        allow yourself to feel whatever is the feeling at that moment. Through allowing you become vast
                        new wholesome. </p>
                    <p>


                        Allow yourself to be in the feelings that the body brings in, so accept it and thus you can find
                        more about it consciously. Inner acceptance of whatever you are experiencing is the present
                        moment. In life whatever matters you has the power to upset me disturb you. How you react to
                        people and situations is best indicator of how deeply you know yourself. </p>
                    <p>


                        To the ego the present moment is at best only useful as a means to an end: You are never fully
                        here because you are always busy trying to get elsewhere. Hence the present moment (now) is
                        treated as an obstacle to be overcome. Life is therefore seen as a problem. The external reality
                        reflects back to your inner state and is then experienced as hostile. Our minds deep seated
                        habit is seeking fullness of life in the future ignoring the present moment!! You ONLY ever
                        experience the present moment or rather what happens in it!! When you are present in the now,
                        then you are fulfilling in itself. </p>
                    <p>

                        Desire for safety stands against every great and noble enterprise: The elimination of time from
                        your consciousness is the elimination of ego. For ego to survive it must make time for past and
                        future and it is taken as more important than the present moment. Ego cannot tolerate becoming
                        friendly with the present moment. </p>
                    <p>

                        Human life is a dance between 2 dimensions: form and space. World is form and peace is space.
                        Suffering is because of overvaluation of form & unawareness of space. We are imprisoned in
                        thought forms, at least become aware of it (& there is inner space). One has to bring a new
                        dimension to the situation, ie, the space, then you look and listen. Thus you become one with
                        the situation. When consciousness is no longer totally absorbed by thinking, some of it remains
                        formless and that is the inner space (no form). Discover the inner space by creating gaps in the
                        stream of thinking. Awareness takes over from thinking. Or it is the separation process of
                        thinking and awareness. Feel the aliveness. </p>
                    <p>

                        This too will pass brings detachment: Non-resistance, non-judgement and non-attachment are 3
                        aspects of true freedom and enlightened living. Refrain from attempting to strengthen your
                        'self'. When someone criticizes you, blames you, just do nothing (instead of retaliating). When
                        you are less burdened by your mind, you can have the joy of being. The inner spaciousness comes
                        from appreciating the simple things like a sound, touch or sight. Finding inner space is being
                        conscious.
                        Living in alignment with inner purpose is foundation of fulfilling your outer purpose. Connect
                        to inner purpose and a deeper meaning flows into what you do. </p>
                    <p>

                        Practical aspect: Be aware of your breathing as often as able to, whenever you remember. Do that
                        for a year and it will be powerfully transformative than attending any courses. Breathing
                        awareness brings us to present moment and key to all inner transformations. Conscious breathing
                        stops our mind. </p>
                    <p>

                        The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm. Enjoy what you are
                        doing and joy flows into it. Generate consciousness through activities of daily life, through
                        their interactions with others as well through 'just being'. </p>

                    <h2>Quiet</h2>
                    <h4>Susan Cain</h4>
                    <p>

                        The book QUIET is full of examples of introverted people, that you finally even feel that the
                        entire world is mostly having introverts than extroverts!! Recently in one of the bookclub
                        meeting, there was a poll on identifying oneself as introvert or extrovert or ambivert, and the
                        result was astounding: around 66% were introverts, with remaining ambivert and zero extrovert.
                        What does that shows to me is that, everyone is quiet and having their inner awareness and space
                        matters a lot for each one of us.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Did you know that, Introversion and extroversion are about 40-50% inherited? Meaning we can
                        stretch our personality but only up to a certain point.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        We were urged to develop an extroverted personality, as a way of out-shining the crowd in a
                        competitive society. Often extroversion is made a prerequisite for leadership. And these easy to
                        get along people are rewarded (traits). We perceive talkers as smarter than quiet ones. We see
                        talkers as leaders. Or those who speak fast as more capable and appealing than slow talkers. No
                        doubt extroverts are better at decoding social cues than introverts. Extroverts put their own
                        stamp on events & in this process they risk losing others' good ideas along the way. Extroverts
                        are credited to care for others while introverts disparaged as people who don't like other
                        people. The downside of introvert could be that if you can't express yourself aside from showing
                        your work, you will be under appreciated. Leaders who are quiet and slow decision makers are not
                        so much valued like quick and assertive ones. Many in the leadership role engage in certain
                        level of pretend- extroversion.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Public speaking phobia has many causes including early childhood setbacks. Introverts are more
                        likely than extroverts to fear public speaking.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        For introverts, being interrupted is one biggest barrier to productivity. They pay to warning
                        signals. Also regular their feelings of desire or excitement. They are good with making a plan,
                        staying with it and disciplined. The main difference between introverts and extroverts are their
                        PREFERENCE for STIMULATION. Stimulation is the amount of input coming in from outside world.
                        Hence introverts like shutting their doors to their offices and plunging into their work, while
                        extroverts function best when engaged in team. Introverts are more sensitive than extroverts.
                        Sensitivity arose as a by-product of survival strategy. Extroverts are longing for a company
                        while introverts desperately crave for downtime and understanding from other person.
                        Relationship for introverts is quality over quantity.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Extroverts are more likely to take quick and dirty approach to problem solving. Introverts stay
                        on task longer, digest information thoroughly. When extroverts are looking at 'what is' while
                        introverts ask 'what if'. Introverts are geared to inspect and extroverts are geared to respond.
                        They scan for problems, focused on a goal and their vigilance increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Introverts can be found as educators and promoters of culture who are able to show value of the
                        interior life .Introverts are likely to hear and implement suggestions. They observe carefully
                        before acting. They are designed to observe and able to detect subtle differences. Introverts
                        spent watching rather than participating in group. They observe before they leap. Introverts
                        express intimate facts about themselves or express their 'real me'. They are not overtly
                        expressive though.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Often introverts discuss of problems or conflicts at work and adopt a counselling mentality,
                        while extroverts establish commonality based discussions with the other person. Introverts
                        experience conversations in their own way, and they make deep and enjoyable connections with
                        others.
                    </p>
                    <p>


                        Introverts need to trust their gut and share their ideas as powerfully as they can. Introverts
                        have smaller response to reward system, while extroverts dopamine pathway is more active than
                        introverts. Introverts are better than extroverts at delaying gratification.

                        When we focus on projects that we care about, we find that our energy is boundless. Teach
                        yourself to pause and reflect when warning signs appear that things aren't working out as hoped.
                        Spend time on what is meaningful for you. Our lives are dramatically enhanced when we are
                        involved in core personal projects that we consider meaningful, manageable and not duly
                        stressful. Our true response to how are things?' Is a function of how well our core personal
                        projects are going.

                        Simple Acts like smiling make us feel stronger while frowning make us feel worse. People who
                        suppress emotions tend to leak those emotions later in unexpected ways. Be aware that we become
                        uncomfortable by wearing a false persona, and eventually burn out.

                        Our frontal cortex is associated with conscious decision making. Amygdala is the small organ in
                        our brain associated with upsetting emotions such as fear of rejection. It is also called the
                        emotional brain. Neocortex (or new brain) is responsible for thinking, planning, language and
                        decision making. It's the seat of rationality or from where we say no, no.

                        We are not determined by our experiences but the meaning we give to that experiences. So it is
                        not about what one is born with but what one makes of it. Life style is something that you
                        choose for yourself. The first step to change is KNOWING. People can change at any time,
                        regardless of the environment they are in. In fact, people are constantly selecting their
                        lifestyle. People have various complaints about their lifestyle, but is easier and more secure
                        to be just the way one is. When we try to change our lifestyle, you are putting COURAGE to the
                        test. There is an anxiety of changing and disappointment of not changing. So if you are not
                        changing, that means you are repeatedly making the decision not to change. You are the one who
                        determines your life. Yes, you are the one who decides how you live. We are so tuned to accept
                        our dissatisfaction with oneself and the world around oneself & with a life that isn't going
                        well. Meaning even our wishes gets fulfilled in many cases nothing about your situation changes
                        at all.

                    <p>

                        Encouragement is accepting oneself. We are afraid of being disliked by others or getting hurt in
                        interpersonal relationships (IPR). ie, we are trying not to get HURT. However it is impossible
                        to not get hurt in your relations with other people. When one enter into IPR, it is inevitable
                        that you will get hurt (small or big), and you will hurt someone. If you don't want this problem
                        all one can do is live in the universe all alone. It would mean you are EXCLUDED from society,
                        people, community etc. All problems in life are IPR problems. Whatever the worry that may arise
                        the shadows of other people are always present. We even dislike ourselves by disliking oneself
                        to avoid IPR. It's like you piercing his heart or my heart!!

                    <p>

                        Feeling of inferiority (FOI) is one's value of judgement of oneself. FOI comes from the pursuit
                        of superiority (POS). When we enter this world as a child, we are a helpless being and develop
                        the desire to escape from that state, which is called the pursuit of superiority. Start walking
                        alone, becoming self-reliant, enter work force etc. It can be a trigger for surviving and
                        growth. Change needs efforts, and courage is required to change your lifestyle. Most find it
                        easier to stay with LIMITATIONS. Ahhhhhhhhhh…that's so true!! FOI make some people attach to
                        powerful person & linking it to authority or it is a fabricated feeling of superiority. This is
                        a common example that can be seen in workplaces. Using one's own misfortune to their advantage
                        is also put into this category.

                    <p>

                        Anger is a tool making others submit to you (a means for achieving their goal). During arguments
                        the other person is challenging you to a power struggle (PS). When challenged to a PS, never
                        allow yourself to be taken in (or bearing it). So the discussion need not be about who is right
                        or who is wrong. The right person need not criticize the other party on that basis. Discussions
                        led by righteousness of assertions lead to a state of IPR of win or lose.

                        IPR arise out of 3 processes: task of work, task of friendship and task of love. These are also
                        called as life tasks. At work, IPR works on a common objective of good results and hence we
                        cooperate with no choice. Task of friendship require a steady courage.

                        *Life is also a social task.
                        In relationship, distance and depth matters. Change oneself than trying to change others. A
                        relationship in which people restrict each other eventually fall apart. Relationship between
                        parent and child is bound in rigid chains and hence this is different from love / marital
                        relationship. It is impossible for a person to live a life completely alone, and only in social
                        contexts that the person becomes an individual. We come up with all types of flaws /
                        shortcomings in others or all pretexts to avoid life task and it is called a LIFE LIE.
                        Separation of task (ie, separate one's task from other people task) is the key. Discard other
                        people's task. Yes, this step can lighten your load and make life simpler.

                        Two opposing ideas explained are the concept of not seeking recognition & separation of tasks,
                        which under the normal social thinking is difficult to be accepted.
                        We are social animals. We have the desire for recognition. We are also suffering trying to meet
                        other people's expectations. Separation of task is a gateway for IPR.
                        Forming a great IPR require a certain degree of distance. One does not intrude in other person's
                        task. One is worried about being judged by other people. One assume that even things that should
                        be other peoples task as one's own. Calmly delineate up to what point one's own task go, and
                        from what point it becomes task of the other person. What one should do is face my own task in
                        my own life without lying.

                        It is not necessary for anyone to have clear cut dreams and objectives.

                        There is no person who wishes to be disliked. However as he accept responsibilities beyond him,
                        and by doing so he turn his own life into a great suffering. On the other hand, it is impossible
                        to live alone, seeking release from IPR is not good. If you are disliked by someone it also
                        shows that you are living in freedom with your own principles. So don't be afraid of being
                        disliked. One just has to separate tasks. The courage to be happy also includes the courage to
                        be disliked. If you are tied with desire for recognition, the IPR card will go to the hands of
                        the other person.

                        Other people are our comrades. We live surrounded by them. Move away from self-interest to
                        concern for others (social interest). In self-centred life style one's sole concern is the 'I'.
                        You are part of community but not its centre - remember this always. Have an active commitment
                        to the community and not simple being here. All of us belong to multiple communities. There is
                        also a larger world that extends far beyond. A sense of belonging is something that one acquires
                        by one's own efforts and it is not something one is endowed at birth. Living in fear of one's
                        relationship falling apart is an unfree way to live. Progression from task separation to
                        community feeling.

                        When one feel that I am beneficial to the community then one get a true sense of one's worth.
                        Meaning I can make contribution to other people. It connect to the deep life awareness. He feels
                        worth just by being here. One accepts oneself on the level of being. Worthiness is something one
                        gives to oneself.

                        What would you be trying to gain by putting brakes on your own innocent behaviour? You can be
                        just yourself!! Self-acceptance is all that is required. Focus on what you can change than that
                        you cannot, and that is exactly self-acceptance. This is me, just AS IT IS. It all comes down to
                        COURAGE to show who you are.

                        Basics of IPR is not founded on trust but in confidence. If you place doubt instead, one can't
                        build a deep relationship. Relationship based on trust is based on security & conditions. Again
                        separation of tasks make life simple. If pain from wounds are focused you can't develop deep
                        relationships. So again courage is required in relationships! Aspire to see others as your
                        comrades. Labour is not just a means of earning money. Through labour one makes contributions to
                        others and commits to one's community and one truly feels as I am of use to someone. One get a
                        greater feeling that Its ok to be here. Confidence is others is another aspect in addition to
                        self-acceptance that enable relationship building.

                        Community feeling: And don't be afraid of being disliked. Remind yourself that, it is common
                        that one go through any number of unpleasant experiences in IPR.
                    </p>

                        With workaholic, the focus is solely on one aspect of life. The most powerful or thought
                        provoking sentence for me in this book was this: It is not acceptable that one's way of living
                        is unusually dominant only one certain aspects of life. By this it meant that we failed in the
                        other aspects of life or life's tasks were not carried out in a way it should have been. They
                        lack harmony in life.
                    </p>

                        The courage to be happy: All problems are due to IPR, and our happiness is to be found in our
                        IPR too. Does that appear contradictory to you? This is because contribution to others gives one
                        happiness. A feeling of contribution is good enough. If one has community feeling, the desire
                        for recognition from others disappear. Similarly there is a danger of aiming to be SPECIAL. Be
                        normal or self-acceptance is the key. Life is not a line, it is actually a series of dots or the
                        moments of NOW. Live in the here and now. Find fulfilment in here. Live more earnestly in here
                        and now. The life that lies ahead of you is a completely Blank page, there are no tracks for you
                        to follow (with your dim light perception). There is no story there. Not living in the NOW is
                        also the greatest life lie.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Life is always SIMPLE. Be fearless. Shine a bright spotlight on here and now. Life in general
                        has no meaning. The meaning is assigned by the individual. People are my comrades and the world
                        is a wonderful place. Have courage to choose the freedom and that happiness. Say I contribute to
                        OTHERS. </p>
