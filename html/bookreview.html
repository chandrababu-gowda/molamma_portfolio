            <h1>Book review</h1>
            <div class="review-section">
                <p>Reading helps to develop our mind, and it enhances your vocabulary and communication skills. I am
                    constantly preparing a reading list, and when the author name or book name come repeatedly in front
                    of me, then I know it's time to hit that book!</p>
                <p>These are a few self-development books that helped me grow as a person.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The artist's way by Julia Cameron</li>
                    <li> Feel the fear and do it anyway by Susan Jeffers</li>
                    <li> Mind set by Carol Dweck</li>
                    <li> A New Earth by Eckart Tolle</li>
                    <li> The courage to be disliked by I Kishimi & F Koga</li>
                    <li> The monk who sold his Ferrari by Robin Sharma</li>
                    <li> Quiet by Susan Cain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reading allowed me to review the essence of the book, and it was summarized and compiled as a blog.
                    Putting what we learned into practice is something we have to practice. In that sense, re-reading
                    the books can help. Self-awareness is the first step, and it allow one to accept oneself, be present
                    or bring back to the 'now', step into your fears, and be a light to others. Happiness is peace.
                    Practice the life SAVERS (Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, Scribing) as said
                    by Hal Elrod.</p>
